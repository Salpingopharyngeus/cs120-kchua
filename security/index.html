    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Product is the backened server of a ride-hailing service. In it's present condition, it allows end-users to
        provide requests for cars, get their requests, update their requests and access the data of all users. We were
        hired to prepare a report listing it's vulnerabilities</p>
    <h3>2. Methodology</h3>
    <p>Readiliy available tools such as the Burp Suite and it's open source variant OWASP ZAP! were utilized to find
        and test for vulnerabilities</p>
    <h3>3. Findings Summary</h3>
    <p>There are a bunch of issues that should be resolved before this project is ever exposed to the public. The
        biggest issue (in multiple variations) is that user data isn't secured, or protected, meaning anyone (with or
        without) an account can not only access data that is not theirs, but also modify the data of others without
        their consent or knowledge. A more detailed report has been provided below notating my recommendations.</p>
    <h3>4. Findings</h3>
    <h4>Sql Injection (get methods lines 66 & 81)</h4>
    <p> While there is protection (through place hodlers) against sql injection in calls made by post requests, there
        are no protections against sql injection in the get requests, meaning that a rouge user could provide a true
        statement as part of the request when requesting the passenger or vehicle requests, and return all the passenger
        or vehicle data. </p>
    <h5>Solution:</h5>
    <p>Anytime data entry and code are mixed, place holders should be used so that rogue sql queries in
        the form of potentially valid text entry can be used to improperly access user data. Consider using some sort of
        validation on the data entry as well, before it even makes it into the database.</p>
    <h4>Protect User Identity / Update Permission (line 41)</h4>
    <p>There is no protection against the users. Anyone can submit update data, and they can utilize the update function
        to not only update their information, but the information of
        everyone else. In the case of a ride-sharing app, a user could potentially change the destinations of ride
        requests if they knew the username of a targeted end user. </p>
    <h5>Solution:</h5>
    <p></p>There needs to be some way to safely authenticate the identity of the users. If a cooke is used,
    make sure to safeguard the cookie against cross site scripting.
    </p>
    <h4>Get All Data Exposed (line 96)</h4>
    <p>There is a huge privacy issue, in the get statement as anyone can request to see all the ride data (get request
        at line 96) and get an itemized list of users, their near (currently whereabouts) and when they made the
        request. </p>
    <h5>Solution:</h5>
    <p>While this is great for debugging/development to check work, this needs to be removed before it is
        allowed into prodction code</p>
    <h3>5. Conclusions</h3>
    <p>This project shows great promise, but needs some additional work to get it to secure that data that has already
        been collected, and safeguard against future malicous agents. Consider implimenting the aforemntioned solutions
        to mediate some of the more obvious and fatal flaws.</p>
