Part 2
To my knowledge, everything works.
No humans were consulted to complete this lab.
I probably sunk 6 hours into this, an hour of which was spent eventually learning that I needed to add the geometry library to api call.

Personal note: This is the ugliest thing I've ever written, and my code is generally far more elegant that this. 






Part 1
To my knowledge, everything is working. 6 cars are presented using the car icon, and map is zoomed in on south station.
Aside from the Google Api doc, no outside help was needed.
2 hours were spent on this lab. The hardest part being realizing that chrome blocked the js file from running, and realizing that I needed the http server.

Prior to optimiztion, the page takes 1.510 seconds to load.
of which: 42 ms are spent loading, 912ms are spent scripting, 60ms rendering, 11ms painting, 149ms on system, and 336ms idling.

With minifying css and adding js to the end of the html it took, 1462ms to load.

minifying js it took 1447ms to load.

There were 72 requests and 381kb transfered.
